# Data Repository for Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Extracellular Enzymes

This repository serves to store data produced from research produced by Jacob T. Perez. The following data is provided:

-   00_PDBs - PDB structures of each enzyme used to generate initial configurations for simulation.

-   01_ColabFold_Statistics - Multiple sequence alignment (MSA), predicted alignment error (PAE), and predicted local distance difference tests (pLDDT) data for each enzyme.
